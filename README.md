# 2.5D Rocket-Simulation

<img src="Rocket_Demo.gif" width="600" alt="Program Demo">

The program simulates a rocket/missile with lateral thrusters. I did this project to test the Unity physics engine and was based off of my [2D missile simulation in Java](https://github.com/ozawatomu/2d-missile-simulation.git). It simply adds force at the thruster positions on the cylinder when they are activated. There are lights, particle systems, and smooth camera motion to give the program some flare.

## Controls
**W** = Main thruster\
**A** = Right thruster\
**D** = Left thruster
